This repository only contains this readme and a pdf of the entire 
documentation of the project including funcional diagrams, manuals
for instalation and usability. The source code can be found in my teams'
shared repository at this link: 
https://github.com/elima123/equipo-dinamite/tree/master/Appix%20Sitio.

The project was for a class at school
to simulate a basic software development product for a client, 
elaborated over the course of 10 weeks and alongside the website 
development agency Appix, located in Queretaro, Mexico.
    The link to the website is this- http://172.212.80.47:3001, 
and it is currently being hosted on a virtual machine provided by Appix, 
and as the course has already ended, it's unclear how long they 
will leave the site up.
